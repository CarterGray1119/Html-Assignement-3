<p>Hello, my name is Carter. Im 18 years old and this is my first post-secondary education. After finishing highschool
    in 2021, I decided to 1 year off of school to figure out what i wanted to do with the rest of my life. after getting
    through half the year without deciding i settled on Interactive Media design and I couldnt be happier about my
    decision doing so. I learned alot about myself during that year including how I enjoy playing and watching
    basketball. Some of my hobbies Include, video games, sports, and music.
</p>

<p>I originally grew up in <b>Oshawa, Ontario</b> and just recently moved to <b>Ottawa</b> for school. So far im
    enjoying my experience very much and enjoy learning a brand new city. Wether in school or life in general, I love
    learing new things and trying new activites that improve me as a person. Recently I started going to the gym at the
    school and I can say im starting to learn why so many people love working out.</p>
